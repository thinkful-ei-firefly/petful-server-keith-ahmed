## API Use Information

<table>
<tr>
<td>
The API can be used to get a list of pets that are available for adoption. These pets are hard coded in the server as a queue. We use a queue for the fifo of pet adoption process.  The routes '/api/cats' and '/api/dogs' are used to access pets that are still available for adoption. There is an endpoint '/api/adopters' that is used to keep a queue of people who are looking to adopt. This has a post method and a delete method so that a user can add their name to a list of people looking to adopt and so that once they adopt they are removed from the list.
